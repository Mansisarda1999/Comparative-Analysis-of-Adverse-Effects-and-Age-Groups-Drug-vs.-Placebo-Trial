* Statistical Analysis of Clinical Trial Data: Conducted comprehensive statistical analyses on clinical trial data to determine the impact of a drug versus a placebo on adverse effects. Utilized z-tests and chi-squared tests to assess proportions and independence of adverse effects, respectively, providing critical insights into treatment efficacy.

* Robust Interpretation of Findings: Employed rigorous statistical techniques to interpret results, including z-scores, p-values, Mann-Whitney U statistics, and effect size measures. Provided clear and concise conclusions based on the evidence, effectively communicating complex statistical findings to diverse stakeholders.

* Data-driven Decision Making: Leveraged statistical findings to inform decision-making processes, highlighting the lack of significant differences in adverse effects between treatment groups and the absence of age disparities. Contributed valuable insights for optimizing clinical trial protocols and enhancing patient care strategies.
